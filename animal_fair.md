# Animal Fair
I went to the animal fair  
The birds and the beasts were there  
The big baboon by the light of the moon  
Was combing his golden hair  
The monkey fell out of his bunk, (clap)  
Slid down the elephantâ€™s trunk, weeeee  
The elephant sneezed and fell on his knees  
And what became of the monkey, monkey
