#Moose Called Fred

There was a Crazy Moose,
Who Liked to Drink a lot of Juice (Repeat)

**Singing Way-oh!
Way-Ho, Way-Ho, Way-Ho, Way-Ho
Way-Ho! Way-Ho! (Loud)
Way-Ho, Way-Ho, Way-Ho, Way-Ho
**

The moose’s name was Fred.
He liked to drink his juice in bed.

He drank his juice with care,
But he spilled some in his hair.

Now he’s a sticky moose.
A moose covered in juice.

All his hair went stiff.
So he combed it in a quiff.

His friends began to laugh.
So he had to take a bath.

As the water went down,
Fred the moose began to drown.
Singing glug-glug-glug-glug

Now let’s all count to five.
Fred the moose is back alive.

Now There’s A Crazy Moose,
And He’s Full up with all the Juice (Once)
And Now He’s On The Loose!
