# Bell and Whistle

**Instructions**	
To prepare, you need a set of 'tokens' for each team (could be one playing card suit, one colour of 'ball-pit balls', or similar). These are distributed one at a time to team members from the 'base'. Team members can only carry one token at a time. 

Two leaders roam the play area with a unique 'call' (we use a bell and a whistle). The bell ringer and the whistler must make a regular call at a fixed interval (once every 30 seconds, or a minute for older scouts). They also have to collect and store any team tokens delivered to them. If the team tokens are big then the bell ringer and the whistler need a plastic bag or something to collect them in. 

To start, every scout gets one team token. They have to deliver their token to either the Bell Ringer or the Whistler then return to base to collect another one. 

The game continues until the time is up or one team has delivered all its tokens. Once that has happened, any scouts returning to base for tokens should be told to remain at the base. 

**IMPORTANT**
Each team is scored according to which roaming leader has the fewest tokens for that team. For example, if the bell ringer has 10 x Team A tokens and the whistler has 8 x Team A tokens, then Team A scores 8. 

Hopefully the team will work out that it pays to coordinate their deliveries and get equal numbers of tokens to each caller. 


# Simple Instructions to Scouts:


1) Distribute starter tokens. 

2) Detail game boundaries, meeting point, and 'return to base' signal. 

3) Game instructions: 

Out there somewhere is a bell ringer and a whistler. You will have to listen carefully as you will only hear their sounds now and again. 

You must deliver your patrol tokens to either the bell ringer or the whistler - the choice is yours. 

When you have delivered a token, you must come back to base and collect another one. 

You can only carry one token at a time. 

The game ends either after [nn] minutes or when one patrol has delivered all of its tokens. 

When the game has finished we will count your team tokens and your score will be the number of tokens delivered to EITHER the bell ringer or the whistler - WHICHEVER IS THE LOWEST NUMBER. For example, if you deliver eight tokens to the whistler, and 10 tokens to the bell ringer, you score 8. 

...Go!

# Additional Information
In we prefer to play this game in the dark so the Scouts have to follow only their ears to find the bell and the whistle, though it could work in the light with a 'hide and seek' aspect to it.
