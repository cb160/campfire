# Tarzan

*This is a repeat after me song*

Tarzan  
Swinging on a rubber band  
Tarzan  
Smacked into a frying pan  
Oooh that hurts!  
Now Tarzan has a tan  
And I hope it doesn't peal  
Like a bannana  

Jane  
Flying on an aeroplane  
Jane  
Crashed into an traffic lane  
Oooh that hurts!
Now Jane has a pain
And Tarzan has a tan  
And I hope it doesn't peal  
Like a bannana  

Cheetah
Rocking to the beata
Cheetah
Got eaten by an amoeba
Oooh that hurts!
Now Cheetah is cavity
And Jane has a pain
And Tarzan has a tan  
And I hope it doesn't peal  
Like a bannana  

Like a bannana
