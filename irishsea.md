#Over the Irish Sea

When I was One, I had just begun

The day I went to sea,  
I climbed aboard a pirate ship and the captain said
to me,  
“We’re going this way, that way,   
forward backwards, Over the Irish Sea  
A bottle of Rum to warm my tum,      
And that’s the life for me. 

When I was two, I tied my shoe... (Chorus)  
When I was three, I bumped my knee ...  
When I was four, I shut the door ...  
When I was five, I was still alive ...  
When I was six, I gathered sticks ...  
When I was seven, I was almost in heaven ...    
When I was eight, I closed the gate ...  
When I was nine, I was feeling Fine ...  
When I was ten, I started again ...   
When I was Old, I had been told of  
When I was Hot, I broke the Pots  
When I was Happy, A Fish gave me a Slappy  
When I was Sad, I turned out Bad  
When I was Drunk, I broke my Bunk  
When this Song ends, I won't Start Again
