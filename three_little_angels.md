# Three Little Angels
Three little angels  
All dressed in white  
Tried to get to Heaven  
On the end of a kite.  
But the kite broke and  
Down they all fell.  
Instead of going to Heaven  
They all went to...  
 
Two little angels...  
One little angel...  
 
Three little devils  
All dressed in red  
Tried to get to Heaven  
On the end of a thread.  
But the thread broke and  
Down they all fell.  
Instead of going to Heaven  
They all went to...  
 
Two little devils...  
One little devil...  
 
Three little Martians  
All dressed in green  
Tried to get to Heaven  
On the end of a string.  
But the string broke and  
Down they all fell.  
Instead of going to Heaven  
They went to...  
 
Two little Martians...  
One little Martian...  

Three little babies  
All dressed in blue  
Tried to get to Heaven  
On the end of a shoe.  
But the shoe broke and  
Down they all fell.  
Instead of going to Heaven  
They all went to...  
 
Two little babies...  
One little baby...  
 
Don’t get excited,  
Don’t lose your head.  
Instead of going to Heaven  
They all went to bed.
