#Runners

The runners are issued with scraps of paper, which they must not lose. 

Chasers will mark a ‘Gotcha’ style spot on
their scrap of paper to indicate a runner has been caught/tagged. 

Once a runner has been caught three the must
return to the base for an additional scrap of paper.

Can be played individually or as teams. The winner/winning team is the one with the least number of spots.

Runners can be pirates, aliens, robbers and Catchers can be sea captains, planetary defence, cops etc depending on
any general camp theme.
