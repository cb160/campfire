# Bungalow

Hey Chatham, Hey Chatham
Let me see your Bungalow, Let me see your bungalow

With my hands up high and me hands down low
This is how I bungalow, this is how I Bungalow

Bungalow, bung, bungalow
Bungalow, bung, bungalow

How *someone*, Hey *someone*
Let me see your bungalow, let me see your bungalow
