#Going On A Bear Hunt

Leader sings a line, audience repeats

We’re all going on a hunt today,  
We’re not scared!  
We’ve got guns!  
Bullets too!

Came across a Field!  
Can’t go over it,  
Can’t go under it,  
Can’t go around it,  
Got to go through it! (Swish, swish, swish...)

Came across a River!  
Can’t go over it,  
Can’t go under it,  
Can’t go around it,  
Got to go swim through it! (Swim, swim, swim..)

Came across a forest!  
Can’t go over it,  
Can’t go under it,  
Can’t go around it,  
Got to chop through it (Chop, chop, chop...)

Came across a mountain!  
Can’t go over it,  
Can’t go under it,  
Can’t go around it,  
Got to dig through it (Dig, dig, dig...)

Came across a cave  
Dark inside  
Something big  
Something furry  
It’s a bear!  
Dig, Dig, Dig, Chop, Chop, Chop, Swim, Swim, Swim, Swish, Swish, Swish
