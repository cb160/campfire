#Raiders
If playing indoors, divide hall into two areas, Scotland and England. If outdoors, mark out two areas, a short distance from each other, with woodland in between 

Split the Section into two teams, giving each a box of treasure (chocolate money or toffees with golden wrapping work well) 

Each team's aim is to defend its territory, yet make surprise raids to steal the opposition's treasure 

A player is killed if two defenders catch them, but only if they are in enemy territory. They are then taken to a back zone as prisoners and play dead 

A sucessful raider can either rescue a prisoner of their own team or grab treasure,rarely both. Then they must escape to their own territory without being caught 

Win the most treasure and do not get wiped out!
