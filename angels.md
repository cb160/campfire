#Angels watching over me

Sun is a-setting in the West; 
Angels watching over me, my Lord. 
Sleep my child, take your rest; 
Angels watching over me.

All night, all day. 
Angels watching over me, my Lord. 
All night, all day. 
Angels watching over me.

Now I lay me down to sleep, 
Angels watching over me, my Lord. 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, 
Angels watching over me.

All night, all day. 
Angels watching over me, my Lord. 
All night, all day. 
Angels watching over me.
