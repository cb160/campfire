# On Top of Spaghetti

On top of spaghetti, 

All covered with cheese,

I lost my poor meatball, 

When somebody sneezed.



It rolled off the table,

And on to the floor,

And then my poor meatball,

Rolled out of the door.



It rolled in the garden,  

And under a bush,

And then my poor meatball,

Was nothing but mush.



The mush was as tasty

As tasty could be,

And then the next summer, 

It grew into a tree.



The tree was all covered,

All covered with moss,

And on it grew meatballs,

And tomato sauce.



So if you eat spaghetti,

All covered with cheese,

Hold on to your meatball,

Whenever you sneeze.
