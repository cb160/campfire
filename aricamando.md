#Aricamando

*This is a repeat after me song*

Now the Princess Pat, Lived in a tree  
And she sailed across, the seven seas  
She sailed across, the channel too  
And she took with, Aricamando  



Aricamando, now what is that  
It's something made, by the princess Pat  
It's red and gold, and purple too  
Thats why it's called, Aricamndo



Now Captain Jack, had a mighty fine crew  
and he sailed across, the channel too  
Now his ship sank, and you will too  
If you don't take, Aricamando
