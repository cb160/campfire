# And the grass grows round and round

And the green green grass grows round and round  
And the green green grass grows round

And in the grass was a hole  
And it was the holiest whole you ever did see  

And the hole was in the ground  
And the green green grass, grew round and round  
And the green green grass grew round  

And in the hole was a trunk  
And it was the trunk it's trunk you ever did see  
  
And the trunk was in the hole  
And the hole was in the ground  
And the green green grass, grew round and round
And the green green grass grew round

And on the trunk was a branch
And it was the branheist branch you ever did see

And the branch was on the trunk
And the trunk was in the hole  
And the hole was in the ground  
And the green green grass, grew round and round
And the green green grass grew round

And on the branch was a twig  
...  

And on the twig was a leaf  
...  

And on the leaf was a nest  
...  

And in the nest was a bird  
...

And on the bird was a feather  
...

And on the feather was a flea  
...

And on a flea was an Elephant ! (Clap - ending song)
