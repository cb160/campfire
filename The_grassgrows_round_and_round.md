# And the grass grows round and round

And the grass grows round and round  
And the grass grows round and round

And in the grass was a hole  
And it was the holiest whole you ever did see  

And the hole was in the ground  
And the green green grass, grew round and round  
And the green green grass grew round  

And in the hole was a trunk  
And it was the trunk it's trunk you ever did see  
  
And the trunk was in the hole  
And the green green grass, grew round and round
And the green green grass grew round
