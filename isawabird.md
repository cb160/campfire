# I saw a bird

This is a repeat after me song

I saw a bird, with a yellow bill
It landed on, my windowsill
I coxed it in, with a slice of bread
and then I bashed, his little head!

I coxed him in, with a lump of cheese
and then I snapped, his little knees!

I coxed him in, with an apple pie
and then I poked, out his little eyes

i coxed him in, with some moldy leek
and then I twisted, his little beak

...with a can of tizer
and then I threw it, into the liquidizer

... with  a spongebob poster
and then i slipped it, into the toaster
