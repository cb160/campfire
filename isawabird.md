# I saw a bird

*This is a repeat after me song*

I saw a bird, with a yellow bill  
It landed on, my windowsill  
I coaxed it in, with a slice of bread  
and then I bashed, his little head!  

... with a lump of cheese  
and then I snapped, his little knees!

...  with an apple pie  
and then I poked, out his little eyes

...  with some moldy leek  
and then I twisted, his little beak

... with a can of tizer  
and then I threw it, into the liquidizer

... with  a spongebob poster  
and then i slipped it, into the toaster
