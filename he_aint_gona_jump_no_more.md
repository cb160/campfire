# He Aint Gona Jump no more

He jumped from forty thousand feet without a parachute,   
He jumped from forty thousand feet without a parachute,   
He jumped from forty thousand feet without a parachute,   
And he ain't gonna jump no more
  
***Chorus : *  
Glory, glory what a helluva way to die,  
Swinging like a giant kite across the bright blue sky
Glory glory, what a helluva way to die  
And he ain't gonna jump no more.  

They scraped him off the runway like a lump of strawberry jam,  
They scraped him off the runway like a lump of strawberry jam,  
They scraped him off the runway like a lump of strawberry jam,  
And he ain't gonna jump no more.... 

They put him in an envelope and sent him home to Mum  
They put him in an envelope and sent him home to Mum  
They put him in an envelope and sent him home to Mum  
And he ain't gonna jump no more....  

She put him on the mantelpiece for all his friends to see  
She put him on the mantelpiece for all his friends to see  
She put him on the mantelpiece for all his friends to see  
And he ain't gonna jump no more....   

The next day in the Naffy they had strawberry jam for tea  
The next day in the Naffy they had strawberry jam for tea  
The next day in the Naffy they had strawberry jam for tea   
And he ain't gonna jump no more....
