I'm being eaten by a boa constrictor \
I'm being eaten by a boa constrictor \
I'm being eaten by a boa constrictor \
And I don't like it very much 

oh no, it's eaten my toes \
oh Jeez, it's got my knees \
oh riddle, it's got my middle \
oh boulder, it's got my shoulder \
oh heck, it's got my neck \
oh dread, it's got my head
